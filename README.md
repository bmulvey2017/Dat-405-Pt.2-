Air Quality of Cities Around the World

Click mouse to change to another city chosen at random.
The number of circles within the canvas reflects the number of pollutants in the air count.
To start on a new canvas, refresh the page or click the mouse.

The circles continue to bounce around within the canvas.
The idea behind this data visualisation is to help the viewer understand the importance of a clean environment and creates 
a realistic but emphasised vision of the pollutants in our atmosphere. By containing the particles within the canvas by 
adding a constraint, it reiterates that the pollution we have created doesn't just disappear and continues to exist in our 
atmosphere unless we do something about it.
